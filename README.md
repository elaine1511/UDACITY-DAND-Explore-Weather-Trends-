# Udacity-DAND-Explore-Weather-Trends-
## Project 1
## Overview
In this project, I analyzed Houston, TX and global temperature data and compared their temperature trends. It includes three parts:
1. Extract the data
2. Data selection and manipulation 
3. Data visualization
4. Observations

## What software do I need?
To complete this project, I used:
- MySQl
- Excel 

## Extract the data
Using the basic SQL query to to retrieve all the temperature data from:
- Local database ( Houston, TX)
- Global database 
Those data were extracted on CSV file for further evaluation.

## Data Selection and Manipulation
Using Excel tool to calculate the moving average for Houston and global. Due to fluctuations in yearly averages, the data was evaluated considering moving averages (10-years) to provide smoother results during data visualization.

## Data Visualization
Using Excel to plot the line charts for local city and global

## Observations
Observe the trends and make observations about the similarities and differences on the trends.
